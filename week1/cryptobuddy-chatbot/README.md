##   Sample Conversation

```
ðŸŒŸ Hey there! I'm CryptoBuddy â€” your friendly crypto sidekick!
 Ask me about trending coins, sustainability, or long-term growth!
Type 'exit' to quit.

You: Which crypto is trending?
CryptoBuddy: These coins are trending up : Bitcoin, Cardano

You: What's the most sustainable?
CryptoBuddy: Invest in Cardano! It's eco-friendly and has long-term potential!

You: exit
CryptoBuddy:  Keep learning and invest wisely. Bye for now!
```

##  How the Bot Works

- Uses **if-else rules** to respond to keywords in your input.
- Loads data from `crypto_data.json`.
- Applies rules to recommend coins:
  - **Trending** = coins with `price_trend: "rising"`
  - **Sustainable** = `sustainability_score >= 7` and `energy_use: "low"`
